title: Longest Uninterrupted Durations of Life Expectancy Decrease
---

# Introduction

This page explores the query: "Which nation has undergone the lengthiest unbroken stretch of declining life expectancy?" <br>
The data source for this analysis: [Life Expectancy](https://ourworldindata.org/).

Given that the available data may exhibit discontinuities in time intervals for certain countries and date ranges, the question can yield two distinct answers, contingent upon our specific definition. We approach the analysis in two distinct manners:

1. When dealing with data that furnishes an observation for each year in a continuous sequence, where each data entry corresponds to one year in succession.
2. When handling data characterized by gaps in the sequenceâ€”for example, observations made every 5 years over a historical period.


# Nations with a Single Observation Per Year in Sequential Order
All of the ten countries facing this unfortunate trend are located in Africa, and Zambia leads the list.

```sql reduction
select *
from reduction_spans
where span_has_gaps = FALSE
order by span desc
limit 10;
```

  <Column id="first_year_in_sequence" title='Start' fmt='id'/>
  <Column id="last_year_in_sequence" title='End' fmt='id'/>

### Fluctuations in Life Expectancy in Zambia from 1951 to 2020
```sql zambia
select newer.year, 
  newer.life_expectancy,
  newer.life_expectancy - older.life_expectancy as change
from life_expectancy newer
join life_expectancy older on newer.entity = older.entity and newer.year = older.year + 1
where newer.entity = 'Zambia'
;
```

### Comparison of Life Expectancy: Zambia vs. Global Average and Neighboring Countries' Average
Zambia's life expectancy consistently outpaced that of its neighboring countries until the onset of a sustained decline in 1978.<br>

### Zambia's National External Debt

Copper stands as Zambia's primary export commodity. Following the conclusion of the Vietnam War, the global copper market experienced a significant downturn. Shortly thereafter, energy prices embarked on a notable upward trajectory. Zambia, being a landlocked nation without direct railway access to seaports, relies heavily on the transportation of copper exports via trucks, which, in turn, depend significantly on petroleum.

# Nations with Discontinuous Yearly Data
The top ten countries exhibiting data gaps tend to be situated in more developed regions, and these data discontinuities typically occur in earlier historical periods. Bangladesh leads the list.<br><br>
_As there are gaps in the yearly observations in the data, this table displays the final recorded observation year preceding the initial occurrence in the sequence of declines._
```sql reductions_with_gaps
select *
from reduction_spans
where span_has_gaps = TRUE
and entity <> 'Europe'
order by span desc

<Details title="Analysis of Bangladesh's Estimated 30 years of Life Expectancy Reduction">
Life expectancy in Bangladesh experienced a distressingly low period during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This challenging situation was exacerbated by the impact of British Raj rule, particularly affecting the region then known as Bengal.<br>

select year,

Thankfully, Bangladesh's life expectancy ascended to align with global averages during the latter half of the 20th century.
